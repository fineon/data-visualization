# CoDash-19 A Public Data Visualization Web App
CoDash was created with an intention to inform the public of the current COVID-19 pandemic, using public dataset and APIs to extract and analyze. 

## Instructions for testing source code
The web app is written using React.JS, Node.JS, SASS CSS pre-processor and Express.js. Therefore, you'll need to have these programs already installed: 
- Node.js
- a good IDE like VSCode for viewing codebase
- SASS -> install it using npm i sass

## To view web app from local codebase
- move to the client folder dir -> use npm start
- move to the server folder dir -> use node index.js

### Have fun!
